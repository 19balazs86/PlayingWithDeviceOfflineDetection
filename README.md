# Playing with device offline detection using Durable Entities

- The idea of this concept came from [Device Offline detection with Durable Entities](https://dev.to/azure/device-offline-detection-with-durable-entities-e8g) by Kees Schollaart. I wanted to try out and learn from this
- I have adopted Azure Functions with Durable Entities in the style of the actor model using Orleans in [this repository](https://github.com/19balazs86/AspireOrleansDeviceOfflineDetection)
